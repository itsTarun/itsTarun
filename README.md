- 👋 Hi, I am Tarun,  I develop iOS apps for iPhone and iPad devices. I have 4 years of experience of mobile apps development with iOS native and 3rd party frameworks. In app development phases, I love R&D part the most. I do the manual testing of app by myself.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source project.
